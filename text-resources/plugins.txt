ES6 modular design HOW TO:

Organizing your own JS code:

1 - Create file responsible for a specific behavior: load_movies.js

2 - Code your desired functions and export them

3 - Import and initialize the functions in your main entry file (index.js)


How to use Plugins (third party libraries):

1- yarn add PLUGIN (typed.js, sortable.js, etc)

2- create init_plugin.js file (src/plugins/init_plugin.js, or lib/plugins/init_plugin.js)

3- import in application.js and initialize your code.

Breaking down step #2:

  2.1 - import plugin
  2.2 - create function with desired behavior
  2.3 - export function
